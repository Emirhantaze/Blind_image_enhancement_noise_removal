variance of the image

laplacian variance of the image (detection of motion blur) https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/09/07/blur-detection-with-opencv/

number of 0 values

number of the 1 values

heigth of the image

width of the image

the image will be dividen in to sub groups 3*3 than getted variance for each section then total variance of the variance outputs
